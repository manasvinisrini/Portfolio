	<h3>Short Summary</h3>
	<p>In the video below, Sawyer moves his arm to keep the pendulum from tipping over. In the beginning, it is easy to see how the system remains stable when no external disturbance is taking place. In the second part, the pendulum shaft is pushed with another wooden dowel two times. The first time is a light push which Sawyer is able to recover from pretty well. The second time is a harder push, but Sawyer still manages to recover nicely. Finally, at the end of the video, one can see how the shaft tips over when the control output is turned off. </p>
