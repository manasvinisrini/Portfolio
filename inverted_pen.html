	<h3>Short Summary</h3>
	<p>In the video below, Baxter begins the coffee making process by picking up the cup and placing it into the Keurig. Next, it raises the lid, picks up the K-cup, and places it inside. Finally, it closes the lid and removes the cup from the Keurig.</p>
	<p>My contribution to the project involved programming Baxter to differentiate between the three items on the table. To do this, blue, yellow, and pink Post-it notes were placed by the cup, Keurig, and K-cup respectively. At program startup, Baxter raises its left arm (which has a camera at the end) to obtain a top-down view of the table. Using color segmentation, the centroid of each Post-it note is found in the camera frame and used to determine the relative order of the items. Next, I linked these items to their world frame equivalents (obtained from a teammate's code using AR tags) by comparing the world frame centroids and matching them to camera frame centroids accordingly.</p>
